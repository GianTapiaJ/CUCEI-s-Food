# CUCEI-s-Food
This is a mobile application developed for the student community, food vendors, and kiosks at CUCEI. It utilizes geolocation technology and an interactive map to facilitate its core functionalities, offering discounts for sustainable container use.

The application allows students to view the temporary and spatial location of both established kiosks and entrepreneurial student vendors. Users can register with a consumer profile to access the interactive CUCEI map and its vendor information, or with a vendor profile to register their location, list their products, set prices, and define their hours of operation.

A key feature of the application is a discount system incentivized by the use of personal containers. This initiative is designed to reduce waste production on the educational campus, thereby fostering a cleaner and healthier environment free of litter.
